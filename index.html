            <p class="blog-paragraph"><strong style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bolder;">H</strong>ere I am once
                again
                trying to create
                a blog template. Once again, but this time
                with flexbox and html.
                What's great about this is that I can add React at any point pretty easily. However my text is looking
                crazy as hell and finding a tutorial on how to format it to look good is a pain in the ass!

            <p class="blog-paragraph">But between you and me it was worth it. Each time I work on this CSS crap I get a
                little bit better. I learn some new tecniques, barely. Its so funny. Whenever I start writing these blog
                pages. I'm angry with my self about how the site looks. However as the day goes by I improve on the
                design and I get much happier with myself and the work that I've done. Maybe I'm being too hard on
                myself. Building software is really hard. Also I'm kinda doing it from scratch, on my own.
